# Installers Guidelines

## Gui

    NAME PREFIX: gui_
    CONTAINS: PACKAGES[GUI] scalar, list of packages

## Storage

    NAME PREFIX: storage_
    CONTAINS: STORAGE array, table of storage partitions/encryption/filesystems

A visual representation of storage configuration in table format.

The storage table should be created so that child storage items (those that are somehow contained within another storage item/device) should be listed below parent items. See sample below.

Btrfs subvolumes can be listed as fstype "btrfs" and as long as their parent volume (or subvolume) is also listed as btrfs they will be identified as subvolumes.

Arbitrary columns can be added to this table for use in the scripts below; just be sure that each colume entry has a - (dash) or value for each "cell" in the table. Values that have spaces (example: if you have a LABEL with a space in it) must be space escaped or quoted. For simplicity's sake, I recommend removing whitespac where possible, however.

An example storage installer file must be named storage_* and contain the following table format variable assigment. See actual sample storage_* files in the same directory as this README for more information.

Note the use of $RAM which will be generated at install time based on the
amount of system memory available and will be formatted "8G" for 8 gigabytes
of system memory, for example.
