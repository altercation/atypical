Atypical Common Script Environment

Files in this directory configure a common script environment for atypical
main and helper scripts.

Some helper scripts (`functions/init-storage`, for example) can be called
directly from the command line. Sourcing the same common environment scripts
here allows us to use the existing values (TMPDIR, LOGFILE, for example) if
the helper function has been called from the main atypical script. Conversely
if the script has been executed directly on the command line, independently of
the atypical master script (as init-storage can be) then it uses these common
files to set up its own, independent script environment (TMPDIR, LOGFILE, etc).
