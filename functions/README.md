# Atypical functions

Functions with an underscore prefix are helpers only, not intended to be called directly.

Functions with no underscore prefix may be called directly.

Files in the frontmatter directory are not functions but are frontmatter for the scripts
that sets up directly executable script options and environment.

All items in this and subdirectories, excluding frontmatter, are set as autoload functions.
